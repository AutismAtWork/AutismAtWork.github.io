      What comes to mind first when asked about "autism"?
      <br> Right: The film Rainman, people with very poor social skills, but with
      island talents, people who require permanent support.
    </p>

    <p>
      We, a group of autistic and non-autistic people, want to correct this wrong picture
      in the minds of many people.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, it is only this wrong impression of us that makes our lives unnecessarily
      complicated. We're no different from you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Did you know that (estimated) 1.1% of humanity is autistic? So roughly: one in 100
      people is an autistic. How many people have you met without noticing?
    </p>

    <p>
      On the following pages you will find a lot of information about autism, about the
      differences between you and "us", and above all how we can benefit from each
      other.
    </p>

    <p>And very important: Thank you! Thank you for your interest!</p>
